Clients provide [requests](https://python-requests.org) and
[httpx](https://www.encode.io/httpx) wrappers which encourage best practices,
particularly always using Sessions to connect to the same host or api endpoint.

# Usage
Typical [requests](https://python-requests.org) usage is redundant and inefficient,
by not taking advantage of connection pooling.

```python
r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', headers={'authorization': token})
r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user/repos', headers={'authorization': token})
```

Using sessions is the better approach,
but more verbose and in practice requires manual url joining.

```python
s = requests.Session()
s.headers['authorization'] = token
r = s.get('https://api.github.com/user')
r = s.get('https://api.github.com/user/repos')
```

## Client
Clients make using sessions easier, with implicit url joining.

```python
client = clients.Client('https://api.github.com/', headers={'authorization': token})
r = client.get('user')
r = client.get('user/repos')
```

## Resource
Resources extend Clients to implicitly handle response content,
with proper checking of status_code and content-type.

```python
github = clients.Resource('https://api.github.com/', headers={'authorization': token})
for repo in github.get('user/repos', params={'visibility': 'public'}):
    ...
```

Resources also implement syntactic support for methods such as __getattr__ and __call__,
providing most of the benefits of custom clients as is.

```python
for repo in github.user.repos(visibility='public'):
    ...
```

Being session based, Clients work seamlessly with other [requests](https://python-requests.org) adapters,
such as [CacheControl](https://cachecontrol.readthedocs.org).
Asynchronous variants of all client types are provided in [Python 3](https://python3statement.org),
using [httpx](https://www.encode.io/httpx) instead of [requests](https://python-requests.org).
Additional clients for [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call),
[GraphQL](http://graphql.org), and proxies also provided.

# Installation

    $ pip install clients

# Dependencies
* requests >=2.4.2
* httpx >=0.8 (if Python >=3.6)

# Tests
100% branch coverage.

    $ pytest [--cov]

# Roadmap
`aiohttp` has made several incompatible changes, including forbidding subclassing.
So the async client has switched to `httpx`.

There are no interface changes to the async client itself, other than the different response object.
In the future `clients` may switch to only `httpx` or `requests3`.
